      # 1. A hypertable to store the materialized data
      # 2. An entry in the jobs table to refresh the data
      # 3. A view definition that union's the hypertable and any recent data
      #    not included in the hypertable
      #
      # That doesn't dump well, even to structure.sql (we lose the job
      # definition, since it's not part of the DDL).

      # aggregate definintions, but we need to override Scenic's schema dumping
